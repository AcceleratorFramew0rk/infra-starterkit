### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Navigate to the Terraform Configuration Directory

```bash
cd /tf/avm/templates/landingzone/configuration/2-solution_accelerators/project/ai_services
```
### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Run the Custom Terraform Script (`tfexe`) to Initialize and Apply

```bash
tfexe apply
```

**Explanation:**

* `tfexe` is a custom wrapper script or executable (located at `/usr/local/bin/tfexe`) designed to manage Terraform commands in a standardized or automated way.
* Running `tfexe apply` performs several behind-the-scenes steps, including:

  1. **Backend Initialization**: It sets up the remote backend (such as Azure Storage Account) to store Terraform state securely.
  2. **Validation & Planning** *(optional)*: It validate your configuration and optionally create a plan.
  3. **Apply Execution**: Finally, it applies the Terraform configuration to create or update resources in Azure.

> This custom script abstracts complexity, enforces consistency, and apply terraform specific logic, such as injecting environment variables, setting backends dynamically, or handling module paths.
