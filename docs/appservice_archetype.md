## Key Features

### 1. **Networking configuration**  
   - **Private Endpoints**: Connect securely without exposing the app to the public internet.  
   - **VNet Integration**: Enables secure outbound calls from the app to other services within the Virtual Network. 

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Microsoft Entra ID Authentication**: Integrates with Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication.
   - **Kubernetes RBAC**: Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control.

### 3. **Container Insights**
   - Azure Monitorâ€™s Container Insights provides monitoring, logging, and alerting for cluster and container-level metrics.

### 4. **Encryption**
   - **At-rest Encryption**: All data is encrypted at rest using Azure's platform-managed encryption keys for robust data protection.

### 5. **Diagnostic Settings**
   - Configured to capture logs and metrics for comprehensive monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 7. **Secrets Management**
   - Utilise Azure Key Vault for secure secrets management.
