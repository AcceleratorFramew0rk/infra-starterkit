azure accelerator framework

Core Purpose of AAF
Accelerate Time-to-Market: Traditional ClickOps Azure deployments typically take months; with AAF and Azure Verified Modules (AVM), Azure Application Landing Zones can be provisioned in hours or days.
Streamline Provisioning & Maintenance: Programmatic IaC Infra provisioning and updates, standardized baseline configurations, and robust drift detection lower the overhead of operating Azure infrastructure.
Enhance Security and Compliance: Opinionated GCC Azure Infrastructure Archetypes strictly follow the Government’s IM8 Cloud Security Policy, which can be applied as-is or customized for unique project requirements. 
High-Level Outcomes
Efficiency Gains: Reduced rework for repeated deployments.
Improved Security Posture: Consistent governance, alignment with Zero Trust principles, and leveraging Azure’s Integrated Security suite (Defender, Sentinel, AD) for unified threats detection and response.
Ease of Adoption: AAF benefits teams new to IaC, as well as veteran practitioners looking for an extensible, well-tested baseline built on Azure IaC framework supported by Microsoft.


Traditional vs. AAF-Based Deployment
Traditional Approach: 
Manual ClickOps configurations and custom IaC code can drag out infrastructure delivery to months.
High potential for misconfiguration, rework, and inconsistent standards.
GCC AAF Approach with AVM: 
Pre-built GCC Archetype Workloads: AKS, App Services, VM Scale Sets, IoT, AI workloads.
Deploy in hours if aligning with existing GCC Archetypes; if a customized design is needed, it typically takes only days to adjust the IaC thanks to AVM.
Significant Time Savings: Large portion of IaC is already validated and standardized.
Concrete Benefit to GCC Projects
Immediate Productivity Gains: Eliminate the need to build IaC from the ground up for each new project.
Faster Testing & Release Cycles: Get infrastructure ready sooner, enabling quicker feature development.
Scalability & Repeatability: Replicate proven solutions across multiple GCC deployments.

Key AAF Features
Pre-Built Templates & Standard Configurations
Common Azure components and best-practice configurations are readily available.
Substantially reduces manual coding for each new environment.
Select an Existing Archetype or Compose a New One from AVMs
GCC Archetype solutions set Azure Infrastructure standards per IM8 Cloud Security Policy. Adopt or adapt existing archetypes or create new ones with AVMs for unique project requirements. 
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Streamlined Provisioning and Updates
One Terraform IaC codebase for multiple environments (Dev, Test, Staging, Production) — only parameters and states change.
Consistency across the board: fewer errors, greater maintainability.
Authorized infrastructure changes can be systematically rolled out via DevSecOps pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD).
Outcome
Lower Ongoing Effort: Automated processes and standardized baseline configurations reduce the manual overhead typically associated with updates.
Continuous Compliance: Early detection of deviations preserves security and governance requirements.
Robust Drift Detection: Terraform Plan and code-diff on Azure ARM templates identify unauthorized changes. Ensures environment integrity and helps maintain compliance with governance policies. Relying on underlying Terraform and Azure capabilities. See appendix for details.

Layered State Management
What Is Layered State Management?
Modular Approach: Groups resources by lifecycle (networking, security, compute, etc.) and separates them into logical, maintainable units.
Environment Segregation: Each environment (dev, staging, prod) has its own state files, preventing accidental cross-environment impact.
Implementation in AAF 
Remote Backends: Stores state files centrally with locking mechanisms, avoiding concurrency conflicts.
Cross-References & Dependencies: AAF automates the resolution of references across layers, ensuring a smooth, orchestrated build.
Scalability & Collaboration: Different teams can work on separate layers without affecting each other’s resources.
Overall Value
Reduced Operational Risk: Changes in one layer do not inadvertently break another.
Enhanced Maintainability: Isolating major components simplifies updates, bug fixes, and troubleshooting.

Archetypes:
Available GCC AAF Archetypes:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
App Services
Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
IoT solutions
AI (Experimental)
Extensibility
The GCC AAF is persistently enhanced and supported by Microsoft full-time employees as an open-source project on GitHub for GCC application landing zones. The GCC Project Teams have the capability to fork the AAF GitHub repository, allowing them to modify existing GCC Archetypes or create new ones tailored to their projects’ unique needs using Azure Verified Modules (AVMs). 
Project Teams could procure and utilize Microsoft Unified hours to collaborate with Microsoft’s Cloud Solutions Architects to co-develop new GCC Archetypes or adapt current ones for specific project requirements.
Reduced Custom Coding: By utilizing AAF Archetypes and AVMs, the development of new GCC Archetypes can be accelerated, leading to rapid and consistent results.
Benefits to GCC
Standardization: Guarantees consistent resource configurations across various application teams.
Efficiency: Reduces or removes the need for repetitive coding for each new project or environment.
Improved Code Quality: Utilizes Azure Verified Modules to inherently incorporate best practices.


**`tfignite`** is a powerful command-line tool designed to **automate and accelerate Terraform deployments**. It simplifies running Terraform **`init`**, **`plan`**, and **`apply`** with flexible configuration options, making infrastructure provisioning faster and more efficient.

SDE - standard development environment
What Is the AAF SDE?
AAF SDE is a standardized VSCode Dev Container providing the exact same Terraform and DevOps toolkit across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Ensures all IaC developers—whether in different teams or different physical locations—are using the same versions of tools and libraries when working with AAF.
Key Features
Consistent Tooling: No more “it works on my machine” issues.
Pre-Installed IaC Components: Terraform, Azure CLI, and relevant plugins are kept current and version-controlled.
Collaboration: Teams share the same environment settings, ensuring consistent processes and conventions.
Why It Matters
Rapid Team Onboarding: New developers can simply open VSCode to get started.
Reduced Errors: Standard environment configuration eliminates compatibility pitfalls.
Improved Velocity: Focus shifts to delivering business value, not wrestling with local setup.
